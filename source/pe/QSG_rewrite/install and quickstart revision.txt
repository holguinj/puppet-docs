Add an Install QuickStart to Basic Install:

Add a "Quest Log" checklist to all QuickStart pages.

Install Quick Start is a POC for folk who don't want to read the "install basic" instructions. It's a monolithic install and basically just a checklist 1. Download tarball, 2. run installer, etc.

Then in current Quickstart, make two flows, one for all *nix, one for heterogenous *nix/win (or maybe all win?).

New Separated Install Instructions tied to scaling guide: Install page for each of Small, Medium, Large, etc. where the deployment architecture follows the scaling guide reccs.

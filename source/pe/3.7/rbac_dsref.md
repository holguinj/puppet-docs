RBAC enables you to connect with a directory service and work with users and groups already established on your directory service. The Directory Service APIs enable you to get information about the directory service, test your directory service connection, and replace directory service connection settings.

### GET /ds
Get the connected directory service information. Web session authentication is required.

**Implemented.**

**Returns:**

* **200 OK** An object representing the connection. If the connection settings have not been specified, then an empty JSON object is
  returned. See [the directory settings](./rbac_ldap.html) for the definitive list of settings.

**Example return:**

        {"name": "AD",
         "hostname": "ds.foobar.com",
         "port": 10379, ...}

**Example empty return:**

      { }

### GET /ds/test
Runs a connection test for the connected directory service. Web session
authentication is required.

**Implemented.**

**Returns:**

* **200 OK** If successful.
* **400 Bad Request** If the request is malformed.
* **401 Unauthorized** If no user is logged in.
* **403 Forbidden** If the current user lacks the permissions to test the directory settings.

In the 200 or 400 case, the body has information about the test run.

**Example returns:**

If error or timeout:

        {"elapsed": 20, "error": "..."}

If success:

        {"elapsed": 10}

### PUT /ds/test
Run a connection test with the submitted settings. Web session authentication is required.

**Accepts:** The full set of directory settings keys with values defined.
Refer to [the directory settings documentation](./rbac_ldap.html) for the full list of settings.

**Implemented.**

**Example returns:**

If error or timeout:

        {"elapsed": 20, "error": "..."}

If success:

### PUT /ds
Replaces current directory service connection settings. Web session authentication is required.

**Accepts:** Directory service connection settings. To "disconnect"
  the DS, `PUT` either an empty object ("{}") or the settings structure with all values set to null. Refer to [the directory settings documentation](./rbac_ldap.html) for the full list of settings.

**Returns:**

* **200 OK** The updated connection settings.

**Example body:**

        {"hostname": "ds.somehost.com",
         "name"
         "port": 10389,
         "login": "frances", ...}

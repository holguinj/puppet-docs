## Overview
Puppet Enterprise (PE) can now connect with directory services, specifically OpenLDAP and Active Directory, by means of role-based access control (RBAC).  This connection enables PE to authenticate lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) groups and to manage user roles, which means you don’t have to create users in two separate locations.

User accounts that originate from an LDAP service are referred to as *remote users*. Those users that are created in PE are *local users*. You can assign roles directly to both remote and local users. However, remote users are also assigned to user roles via the LDAP groups they belong to. When an LDAP group is imported into PE and assigned to roles, the users that belong to that group are also assigned to that role. LDAP groups imported into PE are called *user groups*.

LDAP users or groups are not bulk imported from the directory service into PE. Instead, you explicitly import user groups from a directory service. Remote users must log into PE before they can be seen and managed in RBAC.

If LDAP users aren’t assigned to a group on the directory service, they can still be added to user roles in PE. In those cases, the users must still log in to create an initial RBAC record before they can be added to roles.

This section describes how to connect PE to your external directory service. See [Working with User Roles](./rbac_user_roles.html) for information about managing users and groups. In particular, find out how to [work with users and user groups from an external directory service](./rbac_user_roles.html#working-with-users-and-user-groups-from-an-external-directory-service).

###About LDAP Queries
Queries are constructed using the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF). They consist of relevant relative distinguished name (RDN) + the base DN as a search base, and then filtering by the "lookup" (or "login") attribute.

For example, when querying for a user, Bob, to authenticate, the user RDN (for example, `cn=bob,ou=users`) is concatenated with the base DN (for example, `dc=puppetlabs,dc=com`) to form the search base: `cn=bob,ou=users,dc=puppetlabs,dc=com`. Then the results are filtered to find an entity that has the user lookup attribute. This lookup must return only one entity or the search (for importation, authentication, or syncing) will fail. These same rules apply to the importation of groups.

There is currently an issue where group importation does not respect the group
object class setting, but the group membership syncing does. This means that
groups can be imported that do not match the specified object class type, and
as such, those groups will never be associated with their members.

If you want to use more than one group object class, to solve the above
problem or otherwise, the group object class can be set to "\*".

### Connect to an External Directory Service

You connect to an external directory service by providing the information described here to the PE console.

>**Note**: At present, PE only supports a single Base DN.
>
>**Additionally**: To connect to an LDAP server, RBAC needs to store the username and password configured here, not just a hash of the password. This password must be recoverable in the context of PE. The password is stored in the database in plain text without obfuscation. To guarantee its security, ensure that other processes do not have OS-level read permissions for PE's database or configuration files.

1. From the console, click **Access Control**, and then click **External directory**.
2. Fill in the directory information as described in the following table. All of the fields except for **Login help** are required.

| Field                     | Description        | Example       |
| ---                         | ---                      | ---          |
| Directory name    | Used to refer to the service anywhere it’s mentioned in the UI. | MyActiveDirectory |
| Login help (optional) | Static link for LDAP login assistance | https://myweb.com/ldaploginhelp |
| Hostname | FQDN of the directory service. | devi.delivery.puppetlabs.net |
| Port | The port that PE will use to access the directory service. | 636 |
| Lookup User | Distinguished name of the user to perform directory lookups. | cn=admin,dc=delivery,dc=puppetlabs,dc=net |
| Lookup password | Password of the user who performs lookups. | <password>
| Connection timeout | Number of seconds before the connection will time out. | 10 |
| Connect using SSL | Choose whether to use secure socket layer or not. | select or leave unchecked |
| Base distinguished name | Where in the LDAP tree to find groups and users. | dc=puppetlabs,dc=com |
| User login attribute | Value for users who log in. | cn |
| User email address  | Email address of user | ries@rg-bank.com |
| User full name  | User’s full name. | displayName |
| User relative distinguished name  | The base distinguished name for querying users.  | cn=Users |
| Group object class  | The kind of object that represents groups.  | group  |
| Group membership field  | The way to fetch group membership information. | member  |
| Group name attribute  | The display name for a group.  | name  |
| Group lookup attribute | cn is the default. | cn |
| Group relative distinguished name  | The base distinguished name for looking up groups.  | cn=Groups |


Once you’ve filled in the **External directory** form, click **Test connection** to ensure that the connection has been established. If you’re successful, a green **Success** message will be displayed at the top of the form.

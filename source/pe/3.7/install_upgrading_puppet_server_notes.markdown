PE 3.7.0 introduces Puppet Server, a replacement for the former Apache/Passenger Puppet master stack. However, due to this change in the underlying architecture of the Puppet master, there are a few changes you'll notice after upgrading that we'd like to point out.

This page details some items that are intentionally different between Puppet Server and the old Apache/Passenger stack. Additionally, there are [a few known issues related to Puppet Server](./release_notes.html#issues-related-to-puppet-server) which  we expect to fix in future releases.

### Service Name Changed From `pe-httpd` to `pe-puppetserver`

Previously, the service that acted as the Puppet master was called `pe-httpd`. (So to restart the Puppet master, you would run `service httpd restart`.) 

In PE 3.7 the Puppet master service is now `pe-puppetserver`, and you can restart it with `service pe-puppetserver restart`. 

### New Config Files

Although Puppet Server honors nearly all settings in `puppet.conf`, it moves some the configuration of some features (mostly web server configuration and setting up an external CA) to a group of new config files.

For details about these files, see [Configuring Puppet Server.](./puppet_server_config_files.html)

## Certain Changes Require Service Restarts

You'll need to restart `pe-puppetserver`  any time you make changes to the config files in `/etc/puppetserver/conf.d`. 

You should also restart when making changes to [environments with a long or unlimited `environment_timeout` value.](/puppet/3.7/reference/environments_configuring.html#environmenttimeout) (This is because Puppet Server can have multiple timers running for a given environment --- if a node checks in twice before _all_ of the timers have expired, it can receive inconsistent configurations.)

### Startup and Restarts Take Longer

Puppet Server takes a bit longer to start up than the Apache/Passenger stack. You’ll  see significant performance improvements after start up, but the initial start up is definitely a bit slower. 

### Puppet Server Configuration Files

Information about [Puppet Server configuration files](./puppet_server_config_files.html) can be found in the Puppet Core section of the docs.

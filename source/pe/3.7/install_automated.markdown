You can run the Puppet Enterprise installer while logged into the target server in an automated mode that requires minimal user interaction. The installer will read pre-selected answers to the install configuration questions from an "answer file." There are two steps to the process:

1. Create an answer file or obtain the answer file created by the web-based installer. You can find the latter at `/opt/puppet/share/installer/answers` on the machine from which you ran the installer. 
2. Run the installer with the `-a` or `-A` flag pointed at the answer file.

The flag will cause the installer to read your choices from the answer file and act on them immediately instead of interviewing a user to customize the installation.

Installing with an answer file can greatly speed up large deployments and is crucial when [installing PE with the cloud provisioning tools](./cloudprovisioner_classifying_installing.html#installing-puppet). 

However, please note that an answer file installation requires you to run the installer with an answer file on each node on which you are installing a PE component. In other words, a monolithic installation will require you to run the installer with an answer file on one node, but a split installation will require you to run the installer with an answer file on three nodes. 

>**Warning**: If you're performing a split installation of PE using an answer file, install the components in the following order:
>
> 1. Puppet master
> 2. Puppet DB and database support (which includes the console database)
> 3. The PE console 

### Obtaining an Answer File

Answer files are simply shell scripts that declare variables used by the installer, such as:

    q_install=y
    q_puppet_cloud_install=n
    q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_install=n
    q_puppet_symlinks_install=y
    q_puppetagent_certname=webmirror1.example.com
    q_puppetagent_install=y
    q_puppetagent_server=puppet
    q_puppetmaster_install=n
    q_vendor_packages_install=y

(A full list of these variables is available in the [answer file reference][answerfile].)

To obtain an answer file, you can:

* Use one of the example files provided in the installer's `answers` directory.
* Retrieve the `answers.lastrun` file from a node on which you've already installed PE.
* Write one by hand.

>**Tip**: If you want to use the answer file created from the web-based installer, you can find it at `/opt/puppet/share/installer/answers` on the machine from which you’re running the installer, but note that these answers are overwritten each time you run the installer.

**You must hand edit any pre-made answer file before using it**, as new nodes will need, at a minimum, a unique agent certname.

### Editing Answer Files

Although you can use literal strings in an answer file for one-off installations, you should fill certain variables dynamically with bash subshells if you want your answer files to be reusable. 

To run a subshell that will return the output of its command, use either the `$()` notation...

    q_puppetagent_certname=$(hostname -f)

...or backticks:

    q_puppetagent_certname=`uuidgen`

Answer files can also contain arbitrary shell code and control logic, but you will probably be able to get by with a few simple name-discovery commands.

See the [answer file reference][answerfile] for a complete list of variables and the conditions where they're needed, or simply start editing one of the example files in `answers/`.

### Running the Installer with an Answer File

Once you have your answer file, simply run the installer with the `-a` or `-A` option, providing your answer file as an argument: 

    $ sudo ./puppet-enterprise-installer -a ~/my_answers.txt

* Installing with the `-a` option will fail if any required question variables are not set.
* Installing with the `-A` option will prompt the user for any missing answers to question variables.

#### Additional Global Answers

These answers are optional.

: **Y** or **N** --- Whether to install the puppet master component.

`q_all_in_one_install=y`
: **Y** or **N** --- Whether or not the installation is an all-in-one installation, (i.e., are PuppetDB and the console also being installed on this node).

#### Additional Component Answers

### Puppet Agent Answers

These answers are always needed.

`q_puppetagent_certname=pe-puppet.<your local domain>`
: **String** --- An identifying string for this agent node. This per-node ID must be unique across your entire site. Fully qualified domain names are often used as agent certnames.

### Puppet Master Answers

These answers are generally needed if you are installing the puppet master component.

`q_puppetmaster_certname=pe-puppet.<your local domain>`
: **String** --- An identifying string for the puppet master. This ID must be unique across your entire site. The server’s fully qualified domain name is often used as the puppet master’s certname.

`q_puppetmaster_dnsaltnames=pe-puppet,pe-puppet.<your local domain>`
: **String** --- Valid DNS names at which the puppet master can be reached. Must be a comma-separated list. In a normal installation, defaults to `<hostname>,<hostname.domain>,puppet,puppet.<domain>`.

`q_pe_check_for_updates=n`
: **y** or **n**; **MUST BE LOWERCASE** --- Whether to check for updates whenever the `pe-puppetserver` service restarts. To get the correct update info, the server will pass some basic, anonymous info to Puppet Labs’ servers. Specifically, it will transmit:

   * the IP address of the client
   * the type and version of the client’s OS
   * the installed version of PE
   * the number of nodes licensed and the number of nodes used

If you wish to disable update checks (e.g. if your company policy forbids transmitting this information), you will need to set this to "n". You can also disable checking after installation by editing the `/etc/puppetlabs/installer/answers.install` file.

`q_disable_live_manangement=n`
: **Y** or **N** --- Whether to disable or enable live management in the console. Note that you need to manually add this question to your answer to file before an installation or upgrade.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_httpd_port=443`
: **Integer** --- The port on which to serve the console. The default is port 443, which will allow access to the console from a web browser without manually specifying a port. If port 443 is not available, the installer will try port 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, and 3005.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_user_email=<your email>`
: **String** --- The email address the console’s admin user will use to log in.

`q_puppet_enterpriseconsole_auth_password=<your password>`
: **String** --- The password for the console’s admin user. Must be longer than eight characters.

`q_public_hostname=`
: **String** --- A publicly accessible hostname where the console can be accessed if the host name resolves to a private interface (e.g., Amazon EC2). This is set automatically by the installer on EC2 nodes, but can be set manually in environments with multiple hostnames.

#### Additional Puppet Master Answers

These answers are optional.

`q_tarball_server`
: **String** --- The location from which PE agent tarballs will be downloaded before installation. Note that agent tarballs are only available for certain operating systems. For details, see the [PE agent installation instructions](./install_agents.html).

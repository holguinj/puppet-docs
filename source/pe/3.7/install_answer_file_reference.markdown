You can use answer files to install PE. See [the section on installing with an answer file](./install_automated.html) for more details.

Answer File Syntax
------------------

Answer files consist of normal shell script variable assignments:

    q_database_port=3306

Boolean answers should use Y or N (case-insensitive) rather than true, false, 1, or 0.

A variable can be omitted if a prior answer ensures that it won't be used (i.e. `q_puppetmaster_certname` can be left blank if `q_puppetmaster_install` = n).

Answer files can include arbitrary bash control logic and can assign variables with commands in subshells (`$(command)`). For example, to set an agent node's certname to its fqdn:

    q_puppetagent_certname=$(hostname -f)

To set it to a UUID:

    q_puppetagent_certname=$(uuidgen)

Sample Answer Files
-------------------

PE includes a collection of sample answer files in the `answers` directory of your distribution tarball. Sample answer file references are available for monolithic (all-in-one) and split installations. For split installations, the answer file references are broken out across the various components you will install; there is an answer file for the puppet master, the console, and the PuppetDB components.

In addition to the answer file references for monolithic and split installations, we've included a reference for all possible answers that you can include in an answer file. 

Choose from the following:

* [Complete answer file reference](./install_complete_answer_file_reference.html)
* [Monolithic (all-in-one) installation](./install_mono_answers.html)
* [Split installation (puppet master node)](./install_split_master_answers.html)
* [Split installation (console node)](./install_split_console_answers.html)
* [Split installation (PuppetDB node)](./install_split_puppetdb_answers.html)

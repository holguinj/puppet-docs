Welcome to the Puppet Enterprise Sudo Users Quick Start Guide. This document provides instructions for getting started managing sudo privileges across your PE deployment, using a module from the Puppet Forge in conjunction with a simple module you will write.

In most cases, you want to manage sudo on your agent nodes to control which system users have access to elevated privileges. Using this guide, you will:

* [install the saz-sudo module as the foundation for your management of sudo privileges ](#install-the-saz-sudo-module).
* [write a simple module that contains a class called `privileges` to manage a few resources that set privileges for certain users, which will be managed by the saz-sudo module](#write-the-privileges-class).
* [use the PE console to add classes from the privileges and sudo modules to your agent nodes](#use-the-pe-console-to-add-the-privileges-and-sudo-classes). 

### Install Puppet Enterprise and the Puppet Enterprise Agent

If you haven't already done so, you'll need to get PE installed. See the [system requirements][sys_req] for supported platforms. 

1. [Download and verify the appropriate tarball][downloads].
2. Refer to the [installation overview][install_overview] to determine how you want to install PE, and then follow the instructions provided.
3. Refer to the [agent installation instructions][agent_install] to determine how you want to install your PE agent(s), and then follow the instructions provided.

>**Tip**: Follow the instructions in the [NTP Quick Start Guide](./quick_start_ntp.html) to have PE ensure time is in sync across your deployment.

>**Note**: You can add the sudo and privileges classes to as many agents as needed. For ease of explanation, our console images or instructions might show only two agent nodes.

### Install the saz-sudo Module

The saz-sudo module, available on the Puppet Forge, is one of many modules written by a member of our user community.  You can learn more about the module by visiting [http://forge.puppetlabs.com/saz/sudo](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/saz/sudo). 

**To install the saz-sudo module**:

From the PE master, run `puppet module install saz-sudo`.

You should see output similar to the following: 

        Preparing to install into /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules ...
        Notice: Downloading from http://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
        Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...
        /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules
        └── saz-sudo (v2.3.6)
              └── puppetlabs-stdlib (3.2.2) [/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules]

> That's it! You've just installed the saz-sudo module. You'll need to wait a short time for the Puppet server to refresh before the classes are available to add to your agent nodes.

### Write the `privileges` Class

Some modules can be large, complex, and require a significant amount of trial and error as you create them, while others, like [PE-supported modules](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/supported), often work "right out of the box." This module will be a very simple module to write: it contains just one class.  

> #### A Quick Note about Modules Directories
>
>The first thing to know is that, by default, the modules you use to manage nodes are located in `/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`---this includes modules installed by PE, those that you download from the Forge, and those you write yourself.
>
>**Note**: PE also installs modules in `/opt/puppet/share/puppet/modules`, but don’t modify anything in this directory or add modules of your own to it.
>
>There are plenty of resources about modules and the creation of modules that you can reference. Check out [Modules and Manifests](./puppet_modules_manifests.html), the [Beginner's Guide to Modules](/guides/module_guides/bgtm.html), and the [Puppet Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/).

Modules are directory trees. For this task, you'll create the following files:

 - `privileges` (the module name)
   - `manifests/`
      - `init.pp` (contains the `privileges` class)
  
**To write the `privileges` class**:

1. From the command line on the Puppet master, navigate to the modules directory (`cd /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/modules`).
2. Run `mkdir -p privileges/manifests` to create the new module directory and its manifests directory.
3. Use your text editor to create the `privileges/manifests/init.pp` file.
4. Edit the `init.pp` file so it contains the following Puppet code.

        class privileges {
          user { 'root':
            ensure   => 'present',
            password => '$1$oST1TkX7$p21hU2qzMkR4Iy7HK6zWq0',
            shell    => '/bin/bash',
            uid      => '0',
          }

          sudo::conf { 'admins':
            ensure  => present,
            content => '%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL',
          }

          sudo::conf { 'wheel':
            ensure  => present,
            content => '%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL',
          }

        }

5. Save and exit the file.

> That's it! You've written a module that contains a class that, once applied, ensures that your agent nodes have the correct sudo privileges set for the root user and the “admin” and “wheel” groups. 
>
> Note the following about the resources in the `privileges` class:
>
> * `user ‘root’`: This resource ensures that the root user has a centrally defined password and shell. Puppet enforces this configuration and report on, and remediate, any drift detected, such as if a rogue admin logs in and changes the password on an agent node.
>
> * `sudo::conf ‘admins’`: Create a sudoers rule to ensure that members of the admin group have the ability to run any command using sudo. This resource creates configuration fragment file to define this rule in `/etc/sudoers.d/`. It will be called something like `10_admins`.
>
> * `sudo::conf ‘wheel’`: Create a sudoers rule to ensure that members of the wheel group have the ability to run any command using sudo. This resource creates a configuration fragment to define this rule in `/etc/sudoers.d/`. It will be called something like `10_wheel`.

You will add this class at the same time you add the saz-sudo module.

### Use the PE Console to Add the privileges and sudo classes

[classification_selector]: ./images/quick/classification_selector.png

The saz-sudo module contains several **classes**. [Classes](../puppet/3/reference/lang_classes.html) are named chunks of puppet code and are the primary means by which Puppet Enterprise configures nodes. For this procedure, you're going to add the `sudo` class to the **default** group. 

The **default** group contains all the nodes in your deployment (including the Puppet master), but you can [create your own group](./console_classes_groups_getting_started.html#creating-new-node-groups) or add the classes to individual nodes, depending on your needs. 

**To add the** `sudo` **and** `privileges` **classes to the default group**:

1. From the console, click __Classification__ in the top navigation bar.

   ![classification selection][classification_selector]

2. From the __Classification page__, select the __default__ group.

3. Click the __Classes__ tab. 
   
4. In the __Class name__ field, begin typing `sudo`, and select it from the autocomplete list.

5. Click __Add class__. 

6. Click __Commit 1 change__.

   **Note**: The `sudo` class now appears in the list of classes for the __default__ group, but it has not yet been configured on your nodes. For that to happen, you need to kick off a puppet run. 
   
7. Repeat steps 4 - 6 to add the `privileges` class. 

8. Navigate to the live management page, and select the __Control Puppet__ tab. 

9. Click the __runonce__ action and then __Run__. This will configure the nodes using the newly-assigned classes. Wait one or two minutes.

> Congratulations! You’ve just created the `privileges` class that you can use to define and enforce a sudoers configuration across your PE-managed infrastructure.
